# Cursor Rules

A collection of custom instructions for Cursor AI to help maintain consistency and best practices across your codebase. These rules provide context and guidance to the AI when working with specific frameworks, patterns, or project requirements.

## Available Rules

- `sveltekit.mdc` - SvelteKit conventions and best practices for fullstack development with Bun
- `obsidian_plugin.mdc` - Obsidian plugin development guidelines and patterns

## Usage

1. Place `.mdc` files in your project root or a designated rules directory
2. Cursor AI will automatically detect and apply these rules when relevant to your current task
3. Rules can be framework-specific, project-specific, or contain general development guidelines
